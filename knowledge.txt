Section: Handling a Traffic Accident
In Malaysia, if you are involved in a traffic accident, you must stop your vehicle immediately. It is an offence to flee the scene. If there are injuries, you must provide reasonable assistance, such as calling for an ambulance (999). You must also report the accident to the nearest PDRM (Royal Malaysia Police) station within 24 hours. Do not move the vehicles unless they are causing a major obstruction. It is highly recommended to take photos of the accident scene, the damage to all vehicles involved, and the road tax and insurance details of the other parties.

Section: Understanding Traffic Summons (Saman)
Traffic summons in Malaysia are issued by PDRM (Polis Diraja Malaysia) and JPJ (Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan). There are two main types: compoundable summons and non-compoundable summons. Compoundable summons can be paid at a discount, often during special campaigns. Non-compoundable summons require a court appearance. You can check for outstanding summons online through portals like MyEG or the official PDRM and JPJ websites. Failure to pay summons can result in being blacklisted, which prevents you from renewing your road tax and driving license.

Section: E-Hailing Consumer Rights
E-hailing services (like Grab) are regulated under the Land Public Transport Act 2010. All e-hailing drivers must possess a valid Public Service Vehicle (PSV) license. E-hailing operators must display the fare clearly before you confirm the ride. You have the right to a safe journey, and the vehicle must be in good, road-worthy condition. If you have a complaint about a driver's conduct or the vehicle's safety, you should report it to the e-hailing company's customer service and, if the issue is serious, to APAD (Land Public Transport Agency).
